            <p>As part of the Girls Who Code Summer Program, 
                I collaborated with a team to design and develop personalized websites 
                for each member using HTML and CSS. 
                I built an interactive web application on Replit 
                that used JavaScript to assess and display user personality traits. 
                To support future maintainers and ensure project clarity, 
                I created comprehensive documentation for the codebase, 
                making it easier for instructors and peers to understand 
                and build upon the work.</p>

            <p>I’ve always dreamed of joining Google because of its global impact, 
                commitment to innovation, 
                and culture that empowers creativity and learning. 
                As someone passionate about technology and building meaningful solutions, 
                I’m inspired by how Google uses software to solve complex 
                problems at scale—from making information universally accessible 
                to driving breakthroughs in AI. </p>

            <p>I’ve long admired Susquehanna International Group (SIG)
                 for its innovative use of technology in the world of trading and finance, 
                 and I dream of one day becoming part of its dynamic and intellectually 
                 driven environment. As someone who is passionate about software development 
                 and problem solving, I’m fascinated by how SIG combines technical 
                 expertise with strategic thinking to make data-driven decisions in real time.</p>
